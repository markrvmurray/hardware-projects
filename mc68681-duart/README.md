# 68681 Dual UART board for rosco_m68k

This directory contains both the basic and extended version of the
DUART. The current version that is available for the rosco_m68k 
revision 1.x boards is the basic version. 

The extended version adds the ability to map to either upper of
lower address strobes, and allows the base address to be changed with
a jumper.

Please note that the extended version is currently **not tested**.
