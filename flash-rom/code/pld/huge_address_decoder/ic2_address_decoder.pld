DESCRIPTION

HUGEROM IC2 (Address Decoder) for rosco_m68k

This (experimental!) version of IC2 is intended for use with a hardware 
modification that allows 1MB SST39SF040 Flash ROMs to be used instead of 
AT28Cxxx EEPROMs. The modification involves removing the standard ROMs,
and hooking the appropriate lines up to the flash ROMs, with the high 
four address lines (A16-A19) coming from the expansion connector (or 
other convenient place).

It requires firmware 2.0, built with the HUGEROM=true option enabled.

Note that the address space used by this is software-incompatible with the
standard v1 memory map. Briefly:

* Onboard RAM    : $00000000 - $000FFFFF (1MB)
* Expansion space: $00100000 - $00DFFFFF (14MB)
* ROM            : $00E00000 - $00EFFFFF (1MB)
* IO             : $00F00000 - $FFFFFFFF (1MB)

This layout requires the ROM entry point (initial PC vector) to be set
correctly in the ROM (BOOT operation remains as before). 

No changes to the MFPSEL (IC3) or GLUE (IC5) are required to use this
modified address layout, and most expansion cards should continue to 
work with no changes.

The exception is the memory expansion - to use this, you can no longer
map the expansion RAM to touch the $E00000-$F00000 address space. It
should continue to work fine mapped below that however.
